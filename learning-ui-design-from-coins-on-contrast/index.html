  <h1>Learning UI Design from Coins (on Contrast)</h1>
  
  <p>Contrasts are one of key elements when it comes to usability. Lets take coins as an example.</p>

<p>When it comes to look: at first glance you see differences in size, color (types of metals) and visual patterns.</p>

<p>Feel in hand: some seem heavier, some lighter, some have different surfaces.</p>

<p>Some of these things will help you in one situation, some in another. It&rsquo;s good that they exist.</p>

<p>By analogy, you can do something similar with interfaces.
Font sizes of titles (h1, h2, h3) are well known, trivial example.
Forms are more tricky.</p>

<p>Sign-up and sign-in forms often look similar and appear in similar places.
To create a useful contrasts, we can give them different titles and labels.
We need to remember that users should see what&rsquo;s going on without careful reading.</p>

<p><em>Create an account</em> will make a better title than <em>Sign up</em>, when there&rsquo;s also <em>Sign in</em> on a page.
If you want to stay with <em>Sign up</em>, changing <em>Sign in</em> to <em>Log in</em> will be a good idea.</p>

<p>When it comes to input labels, <em>Your password</em> and <em>Create a password</em> are usefully different.
Way better than just <em>Password</em>.</p>

<p>Two different things need to seem different at first sight.</p>
