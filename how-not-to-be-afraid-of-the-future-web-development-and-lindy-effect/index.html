  <h1>How Not to Be Afraid of the Future: Web Development and Lindy Effect</h1>
  
  <p>No one really knows the future,
but there are some pretty clear patterns worth exploring.
One of them is human nature and Lindy Effect.
Powerful things when combined together.</p>

<p></p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindy_effect">Lindy Effect</a> is a theory that says, in short, that the longer something exists,
the more likely it will survive in the future. It&rsquo;s about things like
technology, books in print, old movies that people are still watching.</p>

<h2 id="repeatable-patterns">Repeatable Patterns</h2>

<p>Shopping with a smartphone sounds like a big, surprising shift in commerce. Right?
Actually it&rsquo;s an effect of a pretty boring process.</p>

<p>We communicate and sell since forever.
Once we figured out a phone, we communicate more at a distance
and deal with telemarketers.
Once we figured out the Internet, we get e-commerce, social
media and email.
Once many people got email addresses, we use them to communicate
and sell on a large scale.
And once we know we can do it at low cost or no cost, we
overdo it.</p>

<p>Everything that can send signals remotely is
used to communicate and do business.</p>

<p>And it&rsquo;s something that supports our already present thinking patterns.
It&rsquo;s never like “reshape your brain or die”.
Good new things are based on old, proven things. When something ignores the
past, it dies.</p>

<p>When you see Google Maps, you know immediately that it&rsquo;s a map. It looks similar
to the old ones. It could look different with todays technology, but would it be
better? When patterns are familiar, you know what&rsquo;s going on.</p>

<p>Technology can survive when it&rsquo;s based on well established patterns.</p>
